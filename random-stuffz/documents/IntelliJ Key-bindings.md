#Productivity, Key-bindings and other awesomeness for IntelliJ IDEA
###by Simen Bekkhus
######Very much a work in progress - Please send me a message if you know of more!

##Useful stuff to know
* [Homepage][1]
* IntelliJ is a polyglot (supports many languages) IDE from [JetBrains][2], the makers of [ReSharper][3], a C# and .NET plugin for Visual Studio.
    * IntelliJ is mainly centred on Java and Web-development, with support for many languages, including [Java][4], [JavaScript][5], Python, [Ruby][6], [PHP][7], [SQL][8] and many more
    * IntelliJ also bundles support for many frameworks and technologies, such as [Android][9], [Spring][10], [Hibernate][11], [Play][12], [NodeJS][13] and others.
    * There is also integration including for other services, such as [VCS][14] (Git, Subversion etc), [build tools][15] (Maven, Gradle, Ant), [Databases][8] (including a terminal), a REST-service, [Servers][16] (GlassFish, WebLogic, TomCat) and many more.
* IntelliJ is built as a (open source) platform, which means it can be extended and split up. There are multiple smaller IDEs based on IntelliJ (such as [Android Studio][17], [PhpStorm][18], [WebStorm][19], [RubyMine][20] etc.), as well as multiple plugins (such as [AngularJS][21], [C/C++ support][22], [static code analysis][23], [JRebel][24], [Atlassian Tools][25] and many more).
* See [here][26] for a full feature-list.

##Tips&Tricks
* IntelliJ natively supports multiple monitors.
 * Just drag and drop a tab or tool/window, and it'll just work.
