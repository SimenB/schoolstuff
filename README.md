# Simen's school-stuff

This is a repository containing all my schoolwork, from the fifth semester at NITH and out.
I'll probably add stuff mildly unrelated to school as well, but this is mostly so that I don't have to use a gazillion different repos, and still utilize VCS, over the course of my studies.
