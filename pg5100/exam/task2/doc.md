Not even time for doc (as per usual).

Task 1 was completed.

Task 2... not so much.

I really didn't have time to nearly complete this assignment.

There is persistence, but not all has been implemented from the front. You can fetch testdata to the front, and it'll come up correctly in the domain objects, but I was not able to display all of it in time.

You can log in, and your own data will be fetched. If you do not exist in the database, you will be created.
